        <h3><span style="background-color:#127067">DBGH idea - A coffee chats’ result</span>
          <br>Some people might think the coffee chats come to the end when you say goodbye to each other and
          see him or her disappear in the crowd. But sometimes you can be inspired by the conversation and that might
          change your days <span style="font-size: .7em">(I want to say life, but might too early to say that)</span>. DBGH is a good example of that.
          <br><br><span style="background-color:#127067">Start - A coffee chat with Rachel</span>
          <br>Some people you just mean to have a chat - you meet them everywhere and that is the sign.
          I met <a style="color: #127067" href="https://www.instagram.com/rachelworcou/" target="_blank">Rachel Worcou</a> in different events, once she was the speaker and later I found out she was my friend’s
          friend <span style="font-size: .7em">(this kind of relationship is very valuable and that helped me a lot along the way)</span>.
          So we grabbed a coffee and talked for a while.
          <br><br>It was such a special chat - for the first time, somebody is willing to share her struggles with
          me <span style="font-size: .7em">(instead of listening to my blah blah blah, kidding)</span>. I always remember that she said, “I was born
          and raised in Australia and I spent one and a half year looking for jobs. I just cannot imagine how hard
          you guys from different cultural backgrounds to do this.” That was also my first time to nearly cry in a coffee chat. 
          <br><br>The thing that affected me the most is one of her works, <a style="color: #127067" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/21523775/Insights-of-an-Intern-Publication" target="_blank"><i>Insights of an intern</i></a>. It is a book about her first
          internship and it recorded all the lessons she learned in the process. I always planned to do some personal projects to keep
          myself creative, and that just gave me the hint, yes, I am always a fan of recording journey and how can I miss this special time.
          <br><br>This is so cool, I need to do it!
          <br><br><span style="background-color:#127067">Push to start - A coffee chat with Stuart</span>
          <br>With the idea in my mind, I met my tutor <a style="color: #127067" href="http://stuart.geddes.work/" target="_blank">Stuart Geddes</a>. I did not plan to chat with him, I just randomly
          saw him in the art book fair in NGV. We had a little chat while he showed me around, reminding me of all those
          old great time <span style="font-size: .7em">(well, not too old - it was only one year ago)</span>. He then said, “Kim and I talked about you the other
          day and we should catch up for coffee together”, and I immediately respond, “ok, when?” 
          <br><br>It was kind of rude but I got the chance to talk with him for hours. He shared his experience exploring his career path and also encouraged
          me to start the project as soon as possible. “You will get hired soon, and then you will have no time to do that”, he
          said <span style="font-size: .7em">(omg, he was so positive that time)</span>.
          <br><br>One big decision that we made together was the platform. Stuart designed so many books and I was inspired by Rachel’s
           book, so it is easy to think of making another one. But for me, I think the digital platform would be better - I want to
           read Rachel’s book, but till now, I still did not get the chance to see the real one. I want a platform that can update
           anytime <span style="font-size: .7em">(do not have to think of the pages)</span> and can be easily accessed - we chose the website. <a style="color: #127067" href="https://xyxy.space/DBGH.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is the process of me
           designing and redesigning it and we will talk about learning to code in another story.
           <br><br><span style="background-color:#127067">Change - many more coffee chats</span>
           <br>Because of the project, I got the chance to meet more people in the industry and all these chats become my materials.
           I also feel the responsibility of making this project on a higher level, for myself and many others at the same stage. That
            kind of thinking reshaped my questions for coffee chats - I have a more specific direction of questions to ask and a clearer
             idea of what info I need. 
            <br><br>In this process, I also feel having a job is not that important to me <span style="font-size: .7em">(it is still a thing though)</span>, instead, I
            care more about how I will use this period to explore more potentials of my career paths.  At the same time, turning
            the stress and pressure into something creative and experimental, like in the forms of art or design <span style="font-size: .7em">(or even stand
            up comedy)</span>, I feel better, much better. 
            <br><br>To be honest, I do not know how long this project will end with, and I do not know how it will go. But it does not matter - it is a journey.
            My other tutor, <a style="color: #127067" href="http://matterofsorts.com/" target="_blank">Vincent Chan</a>, wrote an email to me and said, “you will be fine. Keep at it and enjoy the process if you can.”
            <br><br>Also like Rachel said, “you’ll get there.”
