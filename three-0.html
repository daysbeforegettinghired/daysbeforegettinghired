      <h3>I’ve heard this so many times in the past three months. I hope you’ve heard that a lot as well
      because that means, <span style="background-color:#127067">people are helping you</span>.
      <br><br>In 2017, I came to Australia alone <span style="background-color:#127067">from China</span> and studied the
      <span style="background-color:#127067">Master of Communication Design at RMIT University</span>.
        Besides improving the design skills, I joined many <span style="background-color:#127067">voluntary events and challenges</span>. I also got my first (paid) <span style="background-color:#127067">intern opportunity</span> in Australia from those events.
        After two years, I <span style="background-color:#127067">graduated with Distinction</span>.
      <br><br>Then I was chosen to <span style="background-color:#127067">represent the school</span> for Hong Kong Design Week, after that trip, my parents came to visit me for my graduation ceremony.
      We traveled a little bit in Australia and I finally got the chance to go back to China in these two years, for a holiday.
      <br><br>However, when I came back to <span style="background-color:#127067">Melbourne</span> in <span style="background-color:#127067">January</span> and thought I was ready to work,
      I began to find out that things became harder than I thought...
      <br><br>This is a <span style="background-color:#127067">personal project</span> that recorded my journey in <span style="text-decoration:line-through wavy #127067;">finding my first paid job </span>
      <span style="background-color:#127067">exploring the creative career path in the creative industry in Australia</span>.
      Many people do not like talking about this process, even when I ask them directly, most people just use one or two sentences to summarize it.
      Yes, these moments are not that shiny, and sometimes very dark.
      <br><br>But you will know, or probably already know that, though some people are very lucky, for most of us, <span style="background-color:#127067">this process contains much more</span>.
      Sometimes it is long, so long, too long - If we see this as a game, <span style="background-color:#127067">my mode would definitely be the hard mode</span>, we should admit that.
      <br><br>I feel really grateful that <span style="background-color:#127067">so many people helped me</span> in this journey. I do not know how to pay it back but sharing this with more people.
      <br><br>By the way, I am <a href="https://xyxy.space" target="_blank"><span style="background-color:#FFE380;color:#00A9D1">xyxy</span></a> and <span style="background-color:#127067">I hope this might help you as well</span>...
    <br><br></h3>
