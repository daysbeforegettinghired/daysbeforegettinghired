              <p class="mb-5">After deciding to stay and keep looking for opportunities here, I need to face reality,
                I barely know the industry and I do not know what I want to do.
                <br><br>I know I want to do something about creativity, but honestly, I do not mind doing anything,
                branding, book design, service design, illustration... (and I do not even know that soon
                I will explore much broader, into comedy and performance) All the forms do not matter, I just
                want to tell stories to connect more people (and that is the main theme for me to build my website).
                <br><br>This problem is the whole-time thing that I am focusing on in this project.
                And I actually find out that some people can really have a clear understanding of themselves,
                they know what they want to do and what they can do. Sometimes these two things might not match,
                but people I met always start from what they can do to get to do what they want to do step by step
                (yes, it is a long process and you have the chance to make changes).
                <br><br>So I began by getting to know the industry (or options). My method is to appear on every
                design-related events that I can find. Because I had the experience as a service designer in Metro
                Trains so I started with service design and UX design, and they are reasonably easier to be found.
                GA and Academy Xi always have a lot (and so many free ones). TheDesignKids also organized lots
                of good events (though that time, I was like "only one lecture a month, too little for me. I need more!!!").
                <br><br>As I said, I am not a social person, and I really do not like events full of people.
                The hardest time for me is to wait till it starts (people around me are talking and I am acting
                like I am busy drinking, god, I do not even drink). I never ask questions or do further communication.
                I even have to reduce one or two when I feel this week I have too many events
                (luckily, I still remember that I need to take care of myself).
                <br><br>But it became better when I met someone familiar. I met my design leader in Metro Trains
                three times after the lectures. The first time he was one of the speakers and I finally had the courage
                to go and say hello. He still remembers me, which encouraged me a lot. But we did not talk too much and
                that also happened on the second time. On the third time, he asked me what I am busy with. I said I am
                looking for a job and he said I can help. </p>

            <br><br>He was surprised, but said, "that would be better!"
            <br><br>Another surprising thing happened. <span style="background-color:pink">My parents accepted that decision fast as well</span>.
            <br><br>Yes, it is a good chance to go back, but choosing that also means saying no to many other opportunities -
            <span style="background-color:pink">my dream is in space</span>, not in the university.
            <br><br>My dad said when he heard that, he knew, I will stay and can stay.
            <br><br>I now <span style="background-color:pink">have a stronger willingness</span> to have working experience here and <span style="background-color:pink">I will fight for it</span>.
            <br><br>As Amiel said, you should stay because <span style="background-color:pink">you have so many things to do here</span> (Oh, you ask me who Amiel is? Ha, he is a funny guy I met because I stayed,
            I will get back to him later).
            <br><br>Anyway, my parents would be a little bit bothered by my decision - they need to explain that to my other families.
            Yes, I sometimes doubted if this is my life or not.

              It is so exciting because we are so new and fresh. We <span style="background-color:pink">have so many possibilities</span>
