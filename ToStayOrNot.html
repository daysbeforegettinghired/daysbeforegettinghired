              <p class="mb-5">I always <span style="background-color:pink">accept all the answers</span> in my life (I think it is mainly because I believe in myself that
                <span style="background-color:pink">I can always fix it</span> in some ways),
                but sometimes <span style="background-color:pink">life forces us to make decisions</span> (and I totally understand that in Asian culture, we are not living for only ourselves).
                <br><br>After graduation, though we all have the chance of getting two more years with a graduation visa (full working condition),
                most of my Chinese classmates went back to China - so <span style="background-color:pink">we were left because we did not leave</span>.
                The main reason is that many international students from our program cannot get a proper job in these years
                (we do not even have a networking system for getting more information about that).
                <br><br>So my attitude about that was not very clear - <span style="background-color:pink">it’s like gambling</span> and I struggled a lot (including asked a career advisor from RMIT for help).
                Staying for another two years is fine for me, going back to China is also fine for me. I thought this attitude might not bother me too much, but things
                changed until I received my dad’s messages...
                <br><br>My dad told me there is a chance for me to become a teacher back in my hometown. With a background of study overseas, it would be easier for
                me to get into the system. Compared with <span style="background-color:pink">the high cost of living abroad alone and the limited hope of getting a job here</span>, working back in my hometown
                seems like a good choice.
                <br><br>However, the first thing that came to my mind was <span style="background-color:pink">“no”</span>.
                <br><br>There are two reasons for that. One is that I cannot take responsibility for the students. It is unfair for the students
                who need to step into the industry after graduation get a teacher without working experience - <span style="background-color:pink">
                  Nobody deserves it</span> (though today not many teachers
                think in that way in my hometown, sad!). Another reason is that I feel doubt going back that fast.</p>

                  including go abroad. We can also use that platform to work for the socioty and develop ourselves. We can always change if we
                  meet better chances. Anyway, we can always stay flexible about it and you know, the income is kind of stable and the level for
                  living will be relatively high. We have to think about as a normal person from the normal family.”
                <br><br>“Smart people will know the time to change. They know how to change for the new situation.
                Have a think about it.”

                    <h3>My conversation with my friend who works as a teacher in my hometown.</h3>
              </div></span></a></div>
            </div>
            <p><br><br>I called my friend Rubin, I don’t know why I called him, but I did. As a person who has a similar background, he might understand me more.
            <br><br>He said it is kind of obvious that <span style="background-color:pink">you already know your answer</span> (yes, I find out that most of the times, people always have the answer in
            mind when asking for help). Then our conversation came to the direction about how to tell that decision to my parents.
            <br><br>But surprisingly, I <span style="background-color:pink">made the decision very fast</span>
             - that is mainly because I know the answer and this thing just <span style="background-color:pink">pushed me to have a stronger
            attitude</span>. Most of the time, the attitude of accepting everything saves me from different situations, but sometimes, a stronger attitude helps me
            to <span style="background-color:pink">have a clear mind about future direction and also get to know myself better</span> (like what do I want, what do I care and what do I value).
            <br><br>Another surprising thing happened. <span style="background-color:pink">My parents accepted that decision fast as well</span>.
            <br><br>Yes, it is a good chance to go back, but choosing that also means saying no to many other opportunities -
            <span style="background-color:pink">my dream is in space</span>, not in the university.
            <br><br>My dad said when he heard that, he knew, I will stay and can stay.
            <br><br>I now <span style="background-color:pink">have a stronger willingness</span> to have working experience here and <span style="background-color:pink">I will fight for it</span>.
            <br><br>As Amiel said, you should stay because <span style="background-color:pink">you have so many things to do here</span> (Oh, you ask me who Amiel is? Ha, he is a funny guy I met because I stayed,
            I will get back to him later).
            <br><br>Anyway, my parents would be a little bit bothered by my decision - they need to explain that to my other families.
            Yes, I sometimes doubted if this is my life or not.
            <br><br>But <span style="background-color:pink">not from now</span>.</p>

            <p style="color:#007bff">So many people told me this after talking with me.
              <br><br>Yes, it is a process <span style="background-color:pink">full of challenges and opportunities</span>.
              It is so exciting because we are so new and fresh. We <span style="background-color:pink">have so many possibilities</span>
              though it is so easy to doubt a lot about ourselves.

            I think it is because <span style="background-color:pink">we were born with creativity</span> and <span style="background-color:pink">we live for creativity</span>.
